## 📥 Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Erikgavs/notepad/releases) page
2. Download the latest `notepad_app` binary
3. Make it executable and run:

```bash
chmod +x notepad_app
./notepad_app
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

Clone the repository and build with Cargo:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Erikgavs/notepad.git
cd notepad

# Build in release mode (optimized)
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at: target/release/notepad_app
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
# If built from source
./target/release/notepad_app

# Or if downloaded binary
./notepad_app
```

### Basic Operations

| Action | How to |
|--------|--------|
| **Create a note** | Click the "New note" button, fill in the title and content, then confirm |
| **View notes** | All notes are displayed in the main window as a list |
| **Delete a note** | Click the "Remove" button on any note |

### Data Storage

Your notes are automatically saved to a file called `notas.json` in the same directory where the application runs. This file:

- Is created automatically on first use
- Updates instantly when you add or delete notes
- Uses human-readable JSON format
- Can be backed up or transferred to another machine

**Example `notas.json` structure:**

```json
[
  {
    "title": "My First Note",
    "content": "This is the content of my note."
  },
  {
    "title": "Shopping List",
    "content": "Milk, eggs, bread, butter"
  }
]
```
